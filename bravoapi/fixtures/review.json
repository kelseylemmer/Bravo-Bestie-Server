I am neutral in how I feel about the situation, not that anyone asked. Have happily watched this show since the beginning when it first debuted, so I am an OG. I have loved cheering on this cast and crew from the get go, through the ups and downs, love watching the growth they all have made, very proud of you all. My heart goes out to you Ariana and the cast for their losses over the years. Hope Jax, Britney, Kristen, Stassi and Beau all come back at some point before show decides to end for an OG season and reunion, would be a great send off when that time comes. Anyhow back to the book. This is a great book to have, I recommend it and happy I have a copy. Wish it was signed though, maybe someday. :)",
