As a serial entrepreneur, she owns various businesses, including LUXE marketing, VIDA tequila and her latest venture with her sons, Fresh Wolf. Lisa is forced to evaluate her new-wave Mormon lifestyle when her oldest son, Jack, is ready to leave the nest to find his place in the Mormon church and starts exploring the traditional elements of the religion. Her luxuries and expensive taste rub some of the women the wrong way, leading to a confrontation with newest housewife Monica."
